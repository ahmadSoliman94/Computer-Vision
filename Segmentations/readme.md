### Binary opening and closing operations are image processing techniques used to enhance and manipulate binary images, which are images composed of only black and white pixels and to remove morphological noise.

### __Binary opening:__ is an erosion operation followed by a dilation operation. In erosion, the image is shrunk by removing pixels from the object boundaries, while dilation expands the object by adding pixels to its boundaries. The opening operation is performed by first applying erosion to the binary image, followed by dilation on the resulting image. This operation is useful for removing small objects or thin lines while preserving larger objects in the image.

### __Binary closing:__ is a dilation operation followed by an erosion operation. The dilation operation expands the object by adding pixels to its boundaries, while the erosion operation shrinks the object by removing pixels from its boundaries. The closing operation is performed by first applying dilation to the binary image, followed by erosion on the resulting image. This operation is useful for closing gaps between objects or filling in small holes inside the objects in the image.
