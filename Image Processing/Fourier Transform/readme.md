## Fourier Transform
### In mathematics, a Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical transform that decomposes a function (often a function of time, or a signal) into its constituent frequencies, such as the expression of a musical chord in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its constituent notes. The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time. 


### Fourier transform is widely used in image processing to speed up filtering operations.

## Discrete cosine transformation: 
### is similar to discrete Fourier transform except DCT uses real cosine coefficients. Most of the information for DCT is contained in a handful of coefficients making it ideal for data compression, e.g. JPEG compression. DCT is a linear function with respect to spatial domain therefore, any image processing operation would yield similar results when performed in spatial or DCT domains.

### The difference between DFT and DCT is that DFT uses complex functions while DCT uses real (cosine) functions.
