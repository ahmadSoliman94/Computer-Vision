# Feature: 
### is a piece of information which is relevant for solving the computational task related to a certain application. Features may be specific structures in the image such as points, edges or objects.

### - The features can be classified into two main categories:
1. ### The features that are in specific locations of the images, such as mountain peaks, building corners, doorways, or interestingly shaped patches of snow. These kinds of localized features are often called __keypoint features__.
2. ### The features that can be matched based on their orientation and local appearance (edge profiles) are called __edges__.

<br />

## - Feature Detection:
- ### Detection: Identify the Interest Point.
- ### Description: The local appearance around each feature point is described in some way that is (ideally) invariant under changes in illumination, translation, scale, and in-plane rotation.
- ### Matching: Descriptors are compared across the images, to identify similar features. For two images we may get a set of pairs (Xi, Yi) ↔ (Xi´, Yi´), where (Xi, Yi) is a feature in one image and (Xi´, Yi´) its matching feature in the other image.

- ### Key points: Key points, also known as interest points, They are spatial locations, or points in the image that define what is interesting or what stand out in the image.
<br />

### - Algorithms for Identification:
1. ### Harris Corner.
2. ### SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform).
3. ### SURF(Speeded Up Robust Feature).
4. ### FAST(Features from Accelerated Segment Test).
5. ### ORB(Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).


## - Feature Descriptor
### A feature descriptor is an algorithm which takes an image and outputs feature descriptors/feature vectors. Feature descriptors encode interesting information into a series of numbers and act as a sort of numerical “fingerprint” that can be used to differentiate one feature from another.

### - Local Descriptor: It is a compact representation of a point’s local neighborhood. Local descriptors try to resemble shape and appearance only in a local neighborhood around a point and thus are very suitable for representing it in terms of matching.
### - Global Descriptor: A global descriptor describes the whole image. They are generally not very robust as a change in part of the image may cause it to fail as it will affect the resulting descriptor.

<br />

## - Algorithms:
1. ### SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform)
2. ### SURF(Speeded Up Robust Feature)
3. ### BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints)
4. ### BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)
5. ### ORB(Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)


- ##  Feature matching: is the process of detecting and measuring similarities between features in two or more images. This process can be used to compare images to identify changes or differences between them. Feature matching can also be used to find corresponding points in different images, which can be used for tasks such as panorama stitching and object tracking.

<br />

### -  Algorithems: 
1. ### Brute-Force Matcher
2. ### FLANN(Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) Matcher 

<br />

### - Algorithm For Feature Detection And Matching
1. ### Find a set of distinctive keypoints
2. ### Define a region around each keypoint
3. ### Extract and normalize the region content
4. ### Compute a local descriptor from the normalized region
5. ### Match local descriptors

<br />

### - Brute-Force Matcher: is a simple matcher that takes the descriptor of one feature in first set and is matched with all other features in second set using some distance calculation and find the best match.

### - distance calculation: is the method to calculate the distance between two features.
### types of distance calculation:
### recommended: Hamming distance.

### - Hamming distance: is the number of bits that are different in the binary representation of two numbers.
1. ### calculate the XOR of the two features.
2. ### count the number of set bits in the result.
### for example: 1101 ^ 1010 = 0111, so the Hamming distance is 3.

<br />

## -  Image regestration using Homography is a type of feature-based image registration technique.
- ### Homography is a transformation that maps points in one image to their corresponding points in another image. 
- ### It is a 3x3 matrix that can be computed using a set of matched points between the two images

### - The steps involved in image registration using homography are:

### 1- Detect keypoints in both images using a feature detector such as SIFT, SURF or ORB.
### 2- Compute descriptors for the keypoints.
### 3- Match the keypoints and descriptors between the two images using a matching algorithm such as brute-force matching or FLANN-based matching.
### 4- Use the matched keypoints to estimate the homography matrix using a method such as RANSAC.
### 5- Warp one image using the homography matrix to align it with the other image.

- ### Image registration is an important task in computer vision, with several benefits including:
    1. ### Image alignment: Image registration can be used to align images that are related but have different orientations, scales, or distortions. This is useful in applications such as image fusion, super-resolution imaging, and medical imaging.
    2. ### Object recognition: Image registration can be used to align images of the same object taken from different viewpoints, to aid in object recognition and tracking. This is useful in applications such as robotics, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.
    3. ### Image restoration: Image registration can be used to remove motion blur from images, by aligning multiple images taken at different times to produce a single high-quality image. This is useful in applications such as astronomy, remote sensing, and medical imaging.
    4. ### Optical flow estimation: Image registration can be used to estimate the motion of objects in a sequence of images, which is useful in applications such as video analysis, action recognition, and traffic monitoring.
